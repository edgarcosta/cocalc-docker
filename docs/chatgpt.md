# ChatGPT

CoCalc-docker has ChatGPT integration.  To enable it for all users
you must obtain a ChatGPT API Key from OpenAI.  Then create an admin
user on CoCalc, open the Site Settings section of the Admin settings
page, and do two things:

1. Enable the OpenAI ChatGPT UI setting.
2. Enter your OpenAI API key.

Once this is done you'll see a ChatGPT box on the landing page and there
is ChatGPT integration in any CoCalc chatroom, which you can use via @chatgpt.

## Costs

_**It's suprisingly affordable!**_  There is a [discussion here](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-docker/discussions/188) about costs.
